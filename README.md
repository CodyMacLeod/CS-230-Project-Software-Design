# CS-230-Project-Software-Design

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
Our client, The Gaming Room, had created an android application for their game called Draw It or Lose It. To exapand to further audiences, they wanted us to develop a web application for it so it could be utilized across many platforms such as Mac OS, Linux, Windows, and mobile systems. For this application, there should only be one unique instance of a game at a time, but there can be multiple instances, multiple teams per instance, and multiple players. The game should use verificationa and authentication to ensure players only have access to what they need, limiting administrator priveledges to to specific accounts. 


What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
The area I felt I did particularly well was the recommendations at the end for the operating platform, the system archetctures, storage management, memory management, and security for the application. While there are many viable options for each, I felt there was good reasoning behind each recommendation.


What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Working through the design document proved to be especially helpful in ensuring I understood the clients requirements for the code, particularly the specific requirements for unique game instances and team names which I could have very easily looked over the initial time.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could choose one area to revise, it would be the evalutation tables, particularly when comparing the various operating systems fromt he developers standpoint. I feel I could have gone into more detail on the various costs of each platform as I only really mentioned the price of a Linux system. Going into more details for the other platforms, and especially providing specific numbers could reallt help highlight the differences between the each platform and make the recommendations more helpful.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The biggest part to keep in mind was that users will have varying levels of expertise when it comes to technical skills, as such it was important to make the front end of the system be as simple as possible. Having the program run off nearly any modern browser was a huge design point as the technical requirements to open a browser and visit a site is a rather low barrier to entry compared to other options. It was also important to ensure the user had a smooth and familiar experience regardless of which platform they visited from to avoid any confusion.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
A useful step for designing this software was focusing on the user perspective and what would be most beneficial to them. Once we understood what the user would need and what requirements we needed from our client, we could then look into design and architecture patterns to prepare the actual implementation of the game. The ability to conceptualize the project before diving in is a skill that'll be useful for future projects.
